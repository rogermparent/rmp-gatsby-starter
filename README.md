# RMP Gatsby Starter

This project is based on [the official Gatsby remark example][https://using-remark.gatsbyjs.org].

This project can be used as an example or a template. Its structure aims to ape more "classic" static site generators like Hugo or Hexo with the added power of Gatsby's defaults. It's also meant to be used with [Netlify CMS][https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms], so the structure may awkwardly bend to fit its requirements (like the external siteMetadata file, for instance).
